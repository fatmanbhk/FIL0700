\section{Introduction}
In his 1950 paper "Computing, Machinery and Intelligence" Alan Turing (born on june 23, 1912) first discussed Artificial Intelligence, and proposed the experiment widely known as "The Turing Test", which has been a hot topic of debate over AI ever since. The test is meant to decide whether or not machines can think.

In his paper he argued that in about fifty years' time (meaning around the year 2000) computers would have enough storage capacity so that it would be possible to program them to play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator would not have more than a 70 percent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning.

The pursuit of artificial intelligence has long been a fascinating topic among engineers.  The question "Can machines think?", Turing said he believed to be "too meaningless to deserve discussion". In this paper I will discuss whether or not machines will ever be able to think for themselves. Will we ever be able to fully mimick the human mind?




\section{Conclusion}
Lady Lovelace argued that a computer does exactly what one tells it to via predefined instructions (programming language). It has no emotions, soul, humour, and whether it can think or not can certainly be debated, however my argument is that it cannot. While their way of "thinking"(computing) and then reaching a conclusion can be said to be similar to ours, I pose that it can merely mimick our behaviour, at least for now.\\\\
